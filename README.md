# Hybrid-Framework-for-Supply-Chain-Forecasting-
Applied unsupervised approaches such as :Dynamic Time Warping and State of the Art RNN based LSTMs for improving the demand forecasts of products.
->Analyzing huge volumes of its historical time-stamped data and the critical features defined in the dataset. 
->Discovering the limitation of directly using supervised algorithms for predicting time-stamped daily demand of products. 
->This is a ongoing project, final results are yet to be published.
